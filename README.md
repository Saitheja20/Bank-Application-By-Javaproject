I created a java program for Bank application we can use this application for creating an account, deposit money in account, withdraw money  from Bank account.
 
By using this program, users can easily create new bank accounts by providing their name and initial deposit amount. They can also deposit money into their accounts by specifying the account number and deposit amount. Likewise, they can withdraw money from their accounts by entering the account number and withdrawal amount.


The program demonstrates good object-oriented programming principles by utilizing classes such as Bank and Account to encapsulate related data and behavior. It also leverages the power of collections, using a HashMap to store and retrieve account information efficiently.
  
this Bank application program provides a user-friendly interface and essential banking functionalities, making it a valuable tool for managing personal finances.
